                    Nepathya (Nepali: नेपथ्य, also spelled as Nepathaya) is one name in Nepali Music – which has gained consistent popularity and social recognition. During the past 21 years of its existence- Nepathya has been the trendsetters. They have been the pioneers
                    to blend folk melodies into youth friendly pop and rock format. Folk melodies have remained the life force of Nepathya. Apart from folk, Nepathya’s songs also portray contemporary Nepal – its pain at times of war and distress, and
                    yet the ray of hope an artist sees and imagines of… Critics address Nepathya as the Most Earthy Nepali Band. Formed in 1990 by Deepak Rana (now a Chopper pilot), Bhim Poon (now settled in Hong Kong) and Amrit Gurung, Nepathya has in
                    these 18 years provided platform to many musicians. It has seen 21 new faces come and go, but the name Nepathya and it’s popularity still exists with consistency. Nepathya has been a platform for talented musicians. As music is yet
                    to become a sustainable form of profession in Nepal, long-term commitments from musicians remain rare. Amrit Gurung has remained the guardian, leader and currently the lead vocalist of Nepathya. With 8 albums to its credit, Nepathya
                    from its Chekyo Chekyo days (early 90s) to Jomsome Bazaarma (mid 90s) to Resham (release 2001) to Bhedako Oon Jasto (release 2003) has maintained its consistency in the market.
